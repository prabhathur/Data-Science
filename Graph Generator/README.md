                                            Basic function to create graphs for datasets 
With this function we can automatically generate graphs for any dataset instead of running code again and again. It helps in saving time.

The notebook file has 4 functions: Plot function that chooses the required graph, vartype function that determines the variable type, direcheck function to handle the directories and the main graph function which is the function the user will be calling to get the graphs.

In the graph function the direc argument should be edited to take default location of your dataset directory for convinience.
